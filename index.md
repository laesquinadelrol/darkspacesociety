> **Dark Space Society RPG** is a Cinematic Space Horror Game, inspired by Jesse Ross' *Trophy Dark* and *Trophy Gold*. Players take on the roles of scientists, scouts, engineers, doctors, marines, and teamsters embarking a perilous missions into futuristic, inhospitable and hostile Dark Space environments.

This game is designed to be immersive, player-driven, and emotionally engaging. Horror isn’t just something players encounter as they play —it’s something they create through their actions, failures, and sacrifices. Dice rolls heighten the tension, reinforcing a world where survival is uncertain, and the story unfolds like a space horror film rather than a horror sci-fi simulation.
